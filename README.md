## Leiper: A Homebrew Text Adventure Game

To whom it may concern:

I've always loved **retro** games. One of my favorites is [*Zork, the Underground Empire*](https://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq/zork).
As a neat way to learn some of the basics of Object Oriented Python programming, I decided
to make my own shameless rip-off of Zork. 

At the moment, I've only implemented the "scaffolding" of the game (the parser, each class, etc)
so there isn't much to "play". But all that is to come. 

For now, you need both the nltk and re libraries to run the program correctly, but I am
working on remove nltk as it is quite bulky and I only use it for a few lines. 

Enjoy!
