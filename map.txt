Of no importance currently, only serves to fill in the scenery.
N: River Crossing
S: Cornfield South


River Crossing South
Serves as an obstacle until the player has acquired the iron boots,
which weigh them down enough to be able to wade through the swift
current and reach the homestead from the southeast.
NW: Homestead (initially blocked)
S: Cornfield North


River Crossing West
Serves as an obstacle until the player has acquired the iron boots,
which weigh them down enough to be able to wade through the swift
current and reach the homestead from the west.
E: Homestead (initially blocked)
SW: Water Well


Twin Silos***
Currently does nothing. Planning on having some way to repair
the rusted ladder and then have some kind of treasure on top
of the silos, but that isn't implemented yet.
N: Cornfield South
E: West of Farmhouse
W: Old Barn
SE: Front Yard


Old Barn
Holds the wood ax and the metal bucket. The ax may be used to
destroy several obstacles throughout the map. The bucket may
be used to carry additional items. The path to the workshop is
initially blocked with a locked but fragile wooden door which may
be broken down with the ax.
E: Twin Silos
S: Workshop (initially blocked)
NW: Frog Pond






MORE DOWN, TRYING TO KEEP THINGS RELATIVELY IN ORDER









Tower Laboratory***
The tower library is currently mostly empty. I want there
to be a recipe for some kind of potion that is useful later.
Perhaps an acid to melt through a chain, or a potion of strength
to scale an impossible height/lift a really heavy weight.

Currently the recipe hints at a potion of strength, but I am
liking the idea of an acid. Maybe both?
